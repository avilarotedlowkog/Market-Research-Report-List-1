<p><p>Hydrophilic catheters are medical devices designed for safe and efficient urinary or vascular access, coated with a hydrophilic substance that becomes slippery upon contact with water. This property reduces friction and minimizes irritation during insertion and withdrawal, making them more comfortable for patients. The hydrophilic catheter market is witnessing significant growth, driven by increasing awareness of urinary tract infections (UTIs) associated with catheter use, the rise in chronic diseases requiring long-term catheterization, and advancements in catheter technology.</p><p>The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% during the forecast period, fueled by innovations that enhance product efficacy and patient comfort. Key trends include the development of self-lubricating catheters, the integration of antimicrobial coatings to prevent infections, and growing adoption in home healthcare settings. Moreover, the aging population and rising demand for minimally invasive procedures further contribute to market expansion. As healthcare professionals emphasize patient-centered approaches, hydrophilic catheters are gaining prominence due to their ability to improve clinical outcomes and patient experiences. Sustainable practices in the manufacturing of these devices are also becoming increasingly important as the industry focuses on environmentally friendly solutions.</p></p>
